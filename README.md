## How it works
This searches every .smalli file within its directory (recursively) in order to find two lines of code. This program disables the app's certificate pinning and SSL socket capability. This makes it much easier MITM the app using a program such as Charles Proxy or force the app to connect to a dummy websocket for testing.
